# Demonstration code

## Set up the environment
### Create a new conda env, replace <env_name> with your env name
    conda create --name <env_name> python=3.10.18
    conda activate <env_name>
### Install packages using the requirements.txt file
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the main GUI
On the host machine, cd to the root directory of the repository and run the following command:

    python examples/main_gui.py

## Run the user GUI
On the host machine, find the host IP address using the command:
    ipconfig
and look for the IPv4 address. Then, on the client machine, cd to the root directory of the repository change the host IP address in the user_gui.py file and run the following command:

    python examples/user_gui.py

You can test your connection by:

    ping <host_ip_address>
